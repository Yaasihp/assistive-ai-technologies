# Assistive AI Technologies

## Overview
This repository contains prototypes and projects that use AI to assist people with disabilities or address challenges in underserved communities.

## Why This Matters
Many AI systems are not built with accessibility or equity in mind. These projects explore how data and AI can actively reduce barriers rather than reinforce them.

## Projects
- Object recognition system for low-vision users
- Speech-to-text captioning with contextual tagging
- Mobility aid prediction using wearable data

## Tools & Technologies
Python · OpenCV · TensorFlow · Hugging Face · NLP · Computer Vision

## Goals
- Build inclusive, accessible tools
- Use data ethically to increase independence
- Partner with real user needs and feedback
